### Project Description
Sarcastic Intro: It starts with a simple, interactive game where the user has to drag a fish into a "pothole" to proceed. This sets a lighthearted and sarcastic tone.

AI Analysis: The user can then upload an image of a road. The app uses a powerful AI model (via the Gemini API) to analyze the image and generate a text-based description of the potholes it detects.

Humorous Report: Based on the AI's description, the app calculates how many fish of a certain type (e.g., guppies, sardines) would fit inside the potholes. It displays a "Pothole-Fish Census" report with a total count and an average count of fish per pothole.

Resilient Fallback: The app is designed to be "useless" in a fun way. If the AI fails to detect any potholes or the API connection breaks, the app uses a dynamic, sarcastic fallback. It will generate a random number of "invisible" potholes and a witty explanation, ensuring the app never crashes and always gives a unique result.




### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The deteriorating state of road infrastructure, particularly the prevalence of potholes, poses a significant inconvenience and safety hazard in many urban areas. While traditional reporting mechanisms exist, they often lack engagement and a sense of local context.

This project addresses this issue by transforming a tedious and often frustrating public problem into an interactive and satirical experience. By gamifying the analysis of road damage and providing a humorous, shareable output, the application aims to:

Increase Public Engagement: Create a platform that encourages citizens to document and share images of poor road conditions in a unique and entertaining manner.

Highlight a Local Issue: Focus specifically on the cultural and local context of Thrissur's notorious potholes ("kuzhikal"), making the problem relatable and personal to the community.

Demonstrate AI's Versatility: Showcase the creative and unconventional use of artificial intelligence and computer vision (or simulated vision) in a non-critical, low-stakes environment.

The solution provides a tool that, while "useless" in a conventional sense, serves as a social commentary platform that is both memorable and shareable, turning a public nuisance into a source of satirical amusement and local pride.
